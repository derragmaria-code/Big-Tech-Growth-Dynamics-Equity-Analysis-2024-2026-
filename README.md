# Big-Tech-Growth-Dynamics-Equity-Analysis-2024-2026-
This project uses a custom Python pipeline to analyze the "Growth-Dominant Regime" of Mega-cap Tech. It integrates real-time data to determine why the market is currently rewarding Alphabet over Microsoft despite MSFT's superior margins.
## Data Pipeline
1. **Extraction:** Automated ticker data retrieval via `yfinance`.
2. **Analysis:** Calculation of Pearson correlation ($\rho$) between fundamental metrics (Revenue Growth, P/E, Margins).
3. **Reporting:** Findings are synthesized into a formal LaTeX equity report.

## Key Findings
- **The AI Monetization Gap:** Alphabet's cloud growth has outperformed Microsoft's "mature utility" status in the current cycle.
- **Valuation Paradox:** A high inverse correlation ($\rho = -0.98$) between current profit margins and Forward P/E.
